<p align="center">IntelliJ/Android Studio Plugin for searching artifacts ids of popular Java libraries.</p>

---

This plugin is in JetBrains Plugins Repository! Get it from [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10102-ok-gradle-).


![Take a look](images/look_and_feel.gif)

Use those for adding new dependencies easily to your build.gradle/build.gradle.kts files.

#### Retrofit - which one was it?
```
compile 'com.square.retrofit:retrofit2:2.3.0'
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0'
```

#### Android Design library - which one was it?
```
compile 'com.android.support:design:26.1.0'
compile 'com.android.support:support-design:26.1.0'
```

With this plugin, you won't have to remember it anymore nor open an external browser to search for it on the Internet.

Usage:

Find the **OK, Gradle** action  with `CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+A` shortcut and type library's name that you are looking for in an input field.

To make your life even more easier, assign a shortcut to it. Personally, I prefer `CMD+K` - as in **"OK!"** (I don't use commit action in the IDE anyway).

You need to have an active Internet connection to be able to use this tool.

## Disclaimer
I want to thank <a href="https://chrisbroadfoot.id.au">Chris Broadfoot</a> for creating <a href="http://gradleplease.appspot.com">http://gradleplease.appspot.com</a> website, which was an inspiration for this plugin.

## Roadmap (take it with a grain of salt)
- local storage for collecting info about most used artifacts (for sorting purposes)
- global online db for storing information about most used artifacts (for sorting purposes)
- settings panel for tweaking things
